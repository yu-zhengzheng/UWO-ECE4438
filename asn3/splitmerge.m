function g = splitmerge(f,mindim,fun)
%SPLITMERGE Segment an image using a split-and-merge algorithm.
%   G = SPLITMERGE(F,MINDIM,@PREDICATE) segments image F by using a
%	 split-and-merge approach based on quadtree decomposition. MINDIM (a
%	 nonnegative integer power of 2) specifies the minimum dimension of
%	 the quadtree regions (subimages) allowed. If necessary, the program
%	 pads the input image with zeros to the nearest square size that is
%	 an integer power of 2. This guarantees that the algorithm used in
%	 the quadtree decomposition will be able to split the image down to
%	 blocks of size 1-by-1. The result is cropped back to the original
%	 size of the input image. In the output, G, each connected region is
%	 labeled with a different integer.
%
% 	 Note that in the function call we use @PREDICATE for the value of
% 	 fun. PREDICATE is a a user-defined function that must be in the
%  	 MATLAB path. Its syntax is:
%
%       FLAG = PREDICATE(REGION) must return TRUE if the pixels in
%       REGION satisfy the predicate defined in the body of the
%       function; otherwise, the value of FLAG must be FALSE.

% Pad the image with zeros to the nearest square size that is an integer
% power of 2. This allows decomposition down to regions of size 1-by-1.
PS = 2^nextpow2(max(size(f)));
[M,N] = size(f);
f = padarray(f,[PS - M,PS - N],'post');

% Perform splitting first. 
Z = qtdecomp(f,@split_test,mindim,fun);

% Then, perform merging by looking at each quadregion and setting all
% its elements to 1 if the block satisfies the predicate defined in
% function PREDICATE.

% First, get the size of the largest block. Use function full because Z
% is sparse.
Lmax = full(max(Z(:)));
% Next, set the output image initially to all zeros. The MARKER matrix is
% used later to establish connectivity.
g = zeros(size(f));
MARKER = zeros(size(f));

% Begin the merging stage.
for K = 1:Lmax 
   [vals,r,c] = qtgetblk(f,Z,K);
   if ~isempty(vals)
      % Check the predicate for each of the regions of size K-by-K with
      % coordinates given by vectors r and c.
      for I = 1:length(r)
         xlow = r(I); ylow = c(I);
         xhigh = xlow + K - 1; yhigh = ylow + K - 1;
         region = f(xlow:xhigh,ylow:yhigh);
         flag = fun(region);
         if flag 
            g(xlow:xhigh,ylow:yhigh) = 1;
            MARKER(xlow,ylow) = 1;
         end
      end
   end
end

% Finally, obtain each connected region and label it with a different
% integer value using function bwlabel.
g = bwlabel(imreconstruct(MARKER,g));

% Crop and exit.
g = g(1:M,1:N);

function v = split_test(B,mindim,fun)
% This function determines if quadregion B is split. The function
% returns in v logical 1s (TRUE) for the blocks that should be split and
% logical 0s (FALSE) for those that should not.

% Quadregion B, passed by qtdecomp, is the current decomposition of the
% image into k blocks of size m-by-m.

% k is the number of regions in B at this point in the procedure.
k = size(B,3);

% Perform the split test on each block. If the predicate function (fun)
% returns TRUE, the region is split, so we set the appropriate element
% of v to TRUE. Else, the appropriate element of v is set to FALSE.
v(1:k) = false;
